# Blockchain-Based Construction Project Management

This repository contains a suite of smart contracts designed to streamline construction project management through blockchain technology. These contracts create an immutable, transparent system for verifying contractors, tracking materials, validating milestones, managing inspections, and handling payments.

## Core Components

### Contractor Verification Contract
Validates the credentials, licenses, insurance, and past performance of builders before they can participate in projects, ensuring only qualified contractors are authorized to work.

### Material Tracking Contract
Creates a comprehensive ledger of all construction materials from procurement through installation, enabling full transparency and traceability throughout the supply chain.

### Milestone Verification Contract
Manages the validation and recording of completed project phases, with timestamp verification and approval signatures from relevant stakeholders.

### Inspection Contract
Coordinates regulatory compliance checks and quality assurance reviews, permanently recording inspection results, violations, and remediation efforts.

### Payment Escrow Contract
Secures project funds and automates disbursements based on verified milestone completions and inspection approvals, reducing payment disputes.
